/**
 * The game answers on three hostnames and the browser keeps a separate
 * localStorage for each, so a career saved on www.vctgames.com is invisible
 * on vctgames.com and a card account remembered on the railway.app address
 * asks for its ID again on the real one — 「像换号」. A visitor with nothing
 * stored here is sent to the real address at once. One with a save or an ID
 * stored under this address is told, once per visit, how to carry it over:
 * the career exports to a file and imports on the other side, the card game
 * only needs its ID typed in. Nothing is moved for them — a redirect would
 * have stranded exactly the data this is about.
 *
 * Both only happen once the real address has answered from here. On
 * 2026-09-07 the edge IP behind vctgames.com was blocked from mainland LPL
 * while www and the railway.app address still opened — and this file was
 * bouncing every new visitor from the doors that worked to the one that did
 * not. So the real address is probed first; if it does not answer within a
 * few seconds, this address is the door, and nothing is said.
