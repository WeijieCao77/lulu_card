/**
 * 首尔征途: one team's road through Champions Seoul 2024, replayed in order.
 *
 * The road is history and stays history. The opponents and their order are
 * the ones the team met in August 2024, and winning a match it lost does not
 * change who comes next — that is a rewritten result, not a rewritten bracket.
 * A bracket that branches on your results would be a different mode.
 *
 * Both sides field the 2024 five on event attributes at level 0, with no
 * coach (there are no 2024 coach cards). A collection and its upgrades have
 * no say, which is the point: the year is the same for everybody.
 *
 * Nothing costs 体力 and a lost match is played again for free. With the
 * fives fixed that makes every match close to a coin toss (37–65% in the
 * offline measurement), so what a run keeps is its losses: a team's record is
 * the fewest losses over a finished road. The two 首尔包 are the account's,
 * once — the first match won anywhere, and the first road finished.
