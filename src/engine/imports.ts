/**
 * The optional import rule: at most two players from outside a club's region.
 *
 * Left to itself the market globalises — managers stack a squad with the best
 * of four regions, and so does the AI, which is nothing like the circuit this
 * game is modelled on. With `state.importLimit` on, every club, the player's
 * and the AI's alike, may hold at most IMPORT_MAX players whose nationality
 * belongs to another region, bench included.
 *
 * Origin is nationality, not the `region` field — that one records where a
 * player competes, which is by definition his club's region. A player with no
 * recorded nationality counts as native: an import rule should punish
 * squad-building, never missing data. And the rule gates ACQUISITIONS only.
 * A squad already over the limit when the rule turns on keeps its players —
 * renewals are retention, not recruitment — it simply cannot add more.
