/**
 * The shape of a season, by rulebook.
 *
 * season.ts has always carried one calendar as module constants (STAGES,
 * LEAGUE_DAYS, INTERNATIONAL_OPEN) and branched on a single boolean for the
 * 2026 draws. A career that starts in 2023 plays a different year: LOCK//IN
 * São Paulo in February with every league side in one bracket, one league
 * stage, one Masters (Tokyo), a Last Chance Qualifier per region, then
 * Champions Los Angeles — and LPL outside the leagues, reaching Tokyo and
 * Los Angeles through its own qualifiers.
 *
 * Rather than re-key half the engine, 2023 is laid over the six slots the
 * engine already has: LOCK//IN sits in the Kickoff slot as one cross-region
 * competition, the league in Stage 1, Masters Tokyo in the Masters II slot
 * (the Masters I slot is simply absent from the calendar), the LCQ in the
 * Stage 2 slot as a bracket among the sides not yet through, Champions
 * where it always is. Everything keyed by stage — points, prizes, the
 * board's judgement, the schedule — keeps working; what differs is here.
