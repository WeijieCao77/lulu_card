/**
 * 全队收藏 — the clubs whose players you hold, one card of each man.
 *
 * Asked for by the owner —「解锁 PRX 全队、EDG 全队、NRG 全队」— and derived
 * from the collection each time rather than stored, since nothing is paid
 * out for it yet.
 *
 * Moved out of gacha.ts and fixed on the way: it used to check the ordinary
 * card's id, so a彩卡 — the same man on another night — did not count.
 * Somebody holding 2024 首尔 FMVP ZmjjKK and every other EDG card was told
 * they were still missing ZmjjKK. A club is complete when you hold SOME card
 * of each of its players; which night is your business. (The copy still in
 * gacha.ts is unused and goes when the pack work there lands.)
