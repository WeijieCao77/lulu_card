 * you could stop halfway through to save the meter. Now the ticket is five
 * 体力 at the door — two and a half ladder matches — and after that nothing
 * is charged: you play until you lose or lift it, and how far that is depends
 * on the five you brought. The bracket is three, four or five rounds deep,
 * drawn with the opponents; every round is a step up from where YOU are, so
 * the final is always the hardest club the draw could find, and the final is
 * a best of five.
 *
 * The purse is shaped for that: a little for going out early, more for
 * every round survived, and a title worth more the longer the road was. Per
 * point of 体力 it lands near the ladder for a five that goes out in the
 * first round and above it for one that goes deep, which is the point — the
