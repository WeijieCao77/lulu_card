/**
 * The rest of a club's week, for the seventy-seven clubs the manager does
 * not run.
 *
 * They trained — one focus per player, the same plan the training screen
 * recommends — and did nothing else: no map week, no tape, nobody learning
 * a position the five was missing, nobody on the physio table, the same
 * building for ten years. Everything on the manager's training screen was
 * a lever only he could pull, so by the third season a club run by hand
 * walked over a league that had stood still — 「玩到后面只是单方面的碾压」.
 *
 * So a club now runs the same three-way choice every week, picked the way
 * a sensible coach would: a hole in the five gets a learner on it, an
 * uncomfortable pool gets run, otherwise the coach takes them through the
 * tape — with a map week every third week regardless, because the pool
 * turns over and real teams run maps. The numbers are the manager's own
 * drills' numbers at the club's own coaching and facilities; nothing here
 * is a rate he cannot reach. Pair work is left out: an AI room's bonds do
 * not decay, so there is nothing for it to mend.
