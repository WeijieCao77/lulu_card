/**
 * The manager's day.
 *
 * Every system in the game is worth using, which was exactly the problem: with
 * everything available every day, there was no reason not to do all of it, and
 * a browser game turned into a checklist. A daily budget does not remove
 * options — it makes choosing between them the interesting part.
 *
 * Only outward-facing work costs anything: deals, people, bookings. Setting
 * your own line-up or tactics is free, because a manager should never field a
 * worse five to save an errand, and because those are the decisions players
 * most want to fiddle with.
 */
/**
 * The budget for one turn.
 *
 * The first version gave three a day regardless, which had it backwards: in
 * season the transfer window is shut and commercial work risks condition before
 * a fixture, so two of the three went unused — while a downtime week, with the
 * window open and every negotiation available, was squeezed into the same
 * three. The budget now follows how much there actually is to do.
