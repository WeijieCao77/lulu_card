/**
 * Serves the production build, and collects how it gets played.
 *
 * The static half is deliberately dependency-free: the game is a client-side
 * bundle, so serving `dist/` and falling back to index.html is the whole job.
 *
 * The other half exists because the owner had no way to tell whether anyone
 * came back a second time. It records what people do with the game — never who
 * they are. There are no IP addresses in the database; a browser makes up a
 * random id for itself on first visit and that is the whole of identity.
 * Without a DATABASE_URL the game runs exactly as it did before and every
 * event is dropped on the floor, which is the correct behaviour for a local
 * checkout.
 *
 * The card mode adds the one account this game has, under /api/card — a random
 * string the player keeps, stored only as a hash, holding only a collection.
 * See cards-api.js for why it needs to exist at all. The career mode still has
 * no accounts and still saves in the browser.
