/**
 * vctgames.com/player — the studio's other game, served from where it lives.
 *
 * 英雄联盟选手生涯模拟 (github.com/WeijieCao77/val_player) is its own repository
 * and its own Railway service: a static build, a zero-dependency server that
 * hands it out and counts anonymous events. It keeps all of that. This puts it
 * under this domain by passing /player/… through to that service with the
 * prefix taken off, and the answer back as it came — status, headers, ranges
 * (its music needs 206s for Safari), compression and all. A push to val_player
 * is live here the moment its own deploy is; nothing in this repository is
 * rebuilt for it.
 *
 * PLAYER_UPSTREAM names the service, e.g. http://val-player.railway.internal:8080.
 * The private address, not the public one: val_player rate-limits by the last
 * hop of X-Forwarded-For, which over the private network is the one written
 * here (the caller's address as client-ip.js works it out) and over the public
 * edge would be THIS service's address for every player at once. Unset, the
 * route does not exist and the home page keeps its 「新作预告」 card.
 *
 * Not passed through: /dash and /healthz. The first is that game's owner page
 * and has no business answering on this domain; the second is Railway's probe.
 *
 * The page must sit at /player/ with the slash — its build is relative
 * (vite base './'), so /player would resolve ./assets/… against the root.
