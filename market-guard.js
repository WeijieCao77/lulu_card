/**
 * Scripts on the trading post.
 *
 * 「有几个人写了脚本 24 小时抢交易，别人挂的便宜卡直接一口价拍掉。」 The
 * difference between a script and a person is on the ledger already: HOW SOON
 * after a card was listed it was bought outright, how often, and from how many
 * different people. card_offers has when the winning bid was made,
 * card_listings has when the card went up — so this reads history and needs
 * no new bookkeeping.
 *
 * The thresholds were first guessed from how the client works, and the guess
 * was wrong: read against the live ledger on 2026-09-19 (161 accounts, a week
 * of trades each) a keen person wins a race in 3–6 seconds routinely, and a
 * sniping script is not faster than that — it polls every few seconds and its
 * median is 5 to 30 s. What it does that nobody does by hand is win DOZENS of
 * those races a day, from dozens of different sellers, day after day
 * (813806CD: 664 一口价 in a week from 65 sellers, median 5.4 s; B596D4CE: 516
 * over 22 of the day's 24 hours). And a second kind turned up that nobody had
 * reported: pairs of accounts passing cards back and forth by script, 470
 * times a day at a machine's cadence, with purchases 0.7 s after the listing.
 *
 * What counts is a 一口价 purchase, by its age. A seller counts a few times
 * and no more (SELLER_CAP a day, SELLER_CAP_WEEK a week): two friends — or a
 * player and his alt — handing cards over ARE quick, and that is one seller,
 * however often; sniping is quick purchases from MANY.
 *
 *   A  ultra (≤ 2 s)  ≥ 5 in 24 h                     no hand is that fast: load, tap, tap, confirm
 *                                                     (entries in a 保护期 draw count here, won or lost)
 *   B  quick (≤ 45 s), capped a seller, ≥ 40 in 24 h   forty races won in a day, from a dozen people or more
 *   C  the same over 7 days ≥ 120                      the patient version of B
 *   D  fresh (≤ 5 min) ≥ 100 in 7 d over ≥ 20 of the 24 clock hours   nobody is awake for all of them
 *   E  trading purchases from ONE seller ≥ 30 in 24 h  a main and its alt passing cards across (owner, 2026-09-19:
 *                                                      「这种大小号来回倒检测到也封」 — it was watch-only for a few hours)
 *
 * (A was three at first; the owner made it five on 2026-09-19 and had everybody
 * suspended until then let out.) On that week's ledger these catch 35 of the 161 and leave out the people at
 * the edge (26–39 capped quick purchases on their best day) — those and anybody
 * half-way to a rule are put in front of the owner (「watch」) and not touched.
 * Since the 保护期 (the same day) 「quick」 is measured to 45 s past the END of the
 * protected minute; that was reasoned, not replayed — there was no ledger with a
 * 保护期 in it yet — and is the first thing to re-read against one.
 *
 * Collecting is not trading (owner, 2026-09-19, after rule E suspended four people in an hour: 「很多玩家
 * 会选『没有的卡』，一个一个去拍市场上他没有且价格不高的卡」). On the hot end of this market every cheap
 * card goes within minutes, so somebody filling a collection buys as fresh, as often and from the same prolific
 * sellers as a script does — by age alone the two cannot be told apart. What differs is WHAT is bought: a
 * collector buys each card once and keeps it (Leee: 78 purchases, 77 different cards, none resold), a script
 * buys the same card again and again or puts it straight back on the shelf (4EF44D06: 1899 purchases of 640
 * cards; 0930F66C: two in three relisted). So B, C and E count only TRADING purchases — a card this account
 * had already bought in the window, or one it listed again afterwards. Replayed over the same 161 accounts:
 * everybody suspended by mistake falls to a fifth of a threshold or less, every sniper and every pair stays
 * over, and E's distribution is two humps with nothing between 26 and 187. A and D are about what a body can
 * do and count every purchase as before.
 *
 * Which of them suspend by themselves (owner, 2026-09-19, 「稳一点」): only A and E. What the owner wants gone is
 * a script that buys the instant a card appears — 「卡一发出来它就秒」 — and accounts passing cards between
 * themselves, two, three or four in a ring. What must never be touched is a person who ticks 「没有的卡」 and
 * buys whatever on the shelf looks fairly priced, one card after another, dozens at a time when he has the coins:
 * those cards have mostly been on the shelf a while (bronze nobody else wants), and none of it is speed. A is
 * speed and nothing else. E is a card going round: bought from the same seller again and again, or bought and
 * put back on the shelf, thirty times in a day — which is what a ring looks like from any seat in it (each
 * account keeps buying the same cards from the one before it), and no age limit on it, so waiting out the
 * protected minute hides nothing. B, C and D describe a script too, but a very keen person could brush them,
 * so they put an account in front of the owner (「watch」, with the rule's letter) and suspend nobody.
 * MARKET_GUARD_AUTO lists the letters that do; the default is A,E.
 *
 * Suspensions (MARKET_GUARD=ban, the default): three days the first
 * time, five after that. MARKET_GUARD=watch bans nobody; =off does nothing.
 *
 * Suspended means: no listing, no bidding, no buying, no swaps. Withdrawing,
 * answering and collecting still work, so nothing a suspended account already
 * had on the table is stranded. Evidence is kept with the ban, the owner can
 * lift one (which also forgives everything before the lift), and only
 * purchases made after an account's last ban count toward its next.
 */
/**
 * 上架保护期 (market-api.js): for this long after a card goes up a buy-now is an entry in a draw, and only
 * after it does a buy-now buy at once. It lives here because the guard's clocks are read from it: the race
 * a script wins now starts when the minute ENDS, so 「quick」 runs to QUICK_SEC past that moment, and a
 * purchase in the two seconds after it is as inhuman as one in the two seconds after the listing.
