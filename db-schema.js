/**
 * Bring the schema up to date on boot, without letting that take the game down.
 *
 * The DDL is a long list of `add column if not exists` and `create index if
 * not exists` — catch-up for a database that is nearly always already
 * correct. Two things went wrong with running it plainly.
 *
 * A Railway deploy overlaps containers, so two processes ran the same ALTERs
 * at the same time while the outgoing one was still serving writes, and on
 * 2026-09-09 they deadlocked. Postgres kills one, the throw landed in the
 * catch below, `sql` became null — and a process that never has a database
 * again serves the whole of card mode as 「离线或服务器忙」 until somebody
 * notices and redeploys. An advisory lock now means only one process is
 * inside the DDL at a time, and it waits its turn rather than fighting.
 *
 * And a failed migration is not a reason to throw the connection away. Every
 * table it touches was created by an earlier boot; the one case where the
 * game genuinely cannot run is a database with no card_accounts in it, so
 * that is the only thing asked before keeping the connection.
