/**
 * Which address a request really came from — for rate limiting, and nothing
 * else. Hashed to a bucket key immediately; never stored, logged, or written.
 *
 * Railway sits behind its own proxy, so the socket address is the proxy's and
 * the forwarded chain is what tells callers apart. The client controls the
 * LEFT end of X-Forwarded-For — anyone can prepend a made-up address and get
 * a fresh bucket on every request, which is to say no rate limit at all. The
 * proxy appends the peer it actually saw to the right, so that is the only
 * entry worth reading.
 *
 * With Cloudflare in front of the domain that peer is a Cloudflare node, and
 * every player in the country would land in a few dozen buckets and share
 * their budgets — 429s from the market, the packs and the ladder for people
 * who had done nothing. Cloudflare names the real client in CF-Connecting-IP.
 * That header is trusted only when the rightmost hop is a Cloudflare address:
 * a client talking to Railway directly cannot forge it, because the hop
 * Railway appends is then the client's own, and the header is ignored.
 *
 * Why Cloudflare at all: on 2026-09-07 the Railway edge IP behind the apex
 * domain was blocked from mainland LPL while the other edge IPs were not,
 * so the domain moved behind Cloudflare's proxy.
