/**
 * The trading post.
 *
 * The rule that makes it safe is that both sides pay in when they act and
 * collect afterwards. Listing escrows the CARD; bidding escrows the COINS.
 * Whatever happens next — sold, outbid, unsold, withdrawn — every escrow
 * ends up as a row in card_mail for somebody to collect. Neither side can be
 * left holding nothing because the other one never came back, which is the
 * failure mode a market between asynchronous players actually has.
 *
 * Since 2026-09-07 a listing is an AUCTION: a starting price, a day on the
 * clock, and the top bid wins when the clock runs out — the seller has no
 * say in who. The make-an-offer market it replaces let the seller pick any
 * bid, and the group used that in two ways: a card listed cheap that its
 * seller never sold, with a dozen people's coins locked on it for three
 * days; and a card sold to a friend under a higher bid, which is the gift
 * funnel with extra steps. Under the hammer neither works — a cheap start
 * just sells cheap, and the only way to get the card to a friend is for the
 * friend to outbid everyone. A bid must climb at least five percent over the
 * last, the bidder it beats gets the coins back at once, a bid in the last
 * ten minutes pushes the end back ten minutes, and a bid is binding: neither
 * side can take it back. An optional buy-now price ends the auction on the
 * spot for anyone who pays it.
 *
 * The clock is checked lazily rather than by a job: an auction past its end
 * is settled the moment anyone looks at the market, so the state a player
 * sees is always already correct. Listings from before the change have no
 * `ends` and run out on the old rules — offers within ten percent, the
 * seller answering, three days before an unanswered offer goes home.
 *
 * The collection is the server's now — see engine/actions.ts — so the seller
 * really does own the card: it is taken out of the server's copy of the
 * account at the moment it is listed, and a bid takes the coins out of the
 * bidder's at the moment it is made. A client that says otherwise is not
 * consulted.

   *    under the listing's row lock, as it always did).
   *  - A timer settles ended auctions in batches of SETTLE_BATCH, each batch
   *    one short transaction and about ten statements however many rows are
   *    in it, for at most SETTLE_BUDGET_MS a tick. Rows are claimed with FOR
   *    UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, so two processes (a deploy overlaps containers)
   *    take different rows and neither waits; nothing is remembered in the
   *    process, so a restart just carries on from the table. A batch that
   *    fails is retried a listing at a time, so one bad row cannot hold the
   *    others back, and whatever is left is tried again next tick.
   *  - A request that needs ONE listing settled (relisting when your three
   *    slots are taken by auctions that have ended) settles its own, not
   *    the market's.
   *
   * The sale itself is unchanged: offer accepted, listing sold, card to the

   * transaction that holds the listing's lock, or none of it.
