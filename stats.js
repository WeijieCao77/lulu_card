/**

 * pick a club never advance a single turn" changes the next thing you build.
 *
 * Playtime is deliberately the sum of confirmed active minutes reported by the
 * client, not the wall-clock span of a session. A tab left open overnight
 * reports no heartbeats while it is hidden, so the night is not playtime.

 * and deleted 200k rows a pass until it came under. It never came under, and
 * it could not have. Plain VACUUM marks space reusable but does NOT return it
 * to the operating system — only VACUUM FULL shrinks the file, and that takes
 * an exclusive lock — so the size a DELETE leaves behind is the size it
 * started with. Every boot therefore ran all twenty passes and deleted four
 * million rows however little was actually over, and a day of eight deploys
 * took thirty days of play data down to one.
 *
 * The deeper point is that the rule was never sound in either direction:
 * deleting rows cannot free disk, so it cannot answer the problem it was
 * written for. What bounds the table is the row ceiling, which is exact, and
 * converges, and is trivially checked. Bloat is reported to the dashboard
 * instead of being fought with a chainsaw — if the file is ever far larger
 * than the rows in it, that is a VACUUM FULL to run deliberately, not
 * something a boot should decide on its own.
