A world as it stood at the start of a past season, for the 历史生涯档.

    python3 scripts/build_world_year.py 2024 [--fetch-births]

The 2026 world (build_world.py) is built from this season's tables. A save
that starts in January 2024 needs the world as it was THEN: who was on
which roster, rated on what they had done up to that point, at the age they
were. Everything here is read off caches that already exist:

  scripts/cache/vlr_event_stats.json   every VCT event 2022–2026 with each
                                       participant's line and agents — the
                                       rosters come from the year's opening
                                       events (the four Kickoffs), ability
                                       from the events before the year
  data-raw/liquipedia_players.json     birthdates for the 2026 population
  scripts/cache/liquipedia_births_hist.json
                                       birthdates fetched for everyone else
                                       (--fetch-births, batched, 2.5 s apart,
                                       merged never overwritten)
  src/data/world.json                  ids — a man keeps his P-id, a club its
                                       T-id, so cards and the dossier still
                                       point at the same people; someone the
                                       2026 world never had gets H<n>

Nothing is invented: every player is a line in a real event's stats table,
every roster is the one that played the opening event, an unknown birthdate
is estimated and flagged exactly as build_world does. The second tier is the
2026 Challengers population carried over as a placeholder (meta.tier2), with
the men who were in that year's top tier removed — real Challengers tables
for these years are a later scrape.

Ability is percentile-mapped with build_world's own formulas (imported, not
copied), from the stat lines of the seasons BEFORE the start year, weighted
by recency; a rookie with no earlier line is rated on the opening event
itself, shrunk hard toward the unproven anchor.
