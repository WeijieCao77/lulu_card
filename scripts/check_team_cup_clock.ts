/**
 * A cup's clock survives a pass that never comes back.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/check_team_cup_clock.ts   (ported from Val_Manager bf8f6df)
 *
 * 2026-09-21, 「全服组队杯卡住了，一直在 0 秒」: the 21:00 cup played five ties
 * and stopped at round 0 for an hour and a half. Nothing was wrong with the
 * bracket and nothing was in the log — a pass had stopped on an await that
 * never answered, and `running ??=` handed that same pending promise to every
 * tick after it. One await froze a 485-player tournament in silence.
 *
 * So: a pass that does not come back is abandoned, the caller is told (which
 * is how it reaches the log), the worker it may have been waiting on is
 * thrown away, and the next tick plays the round that was owed.
