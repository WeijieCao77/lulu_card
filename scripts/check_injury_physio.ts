/**
 * Injuries follow condition; money buys treatment; rosters stop at seven.
 *
 * The group reported three things at once: squads with four of seven injured,
 * one player relapsing the week he returned, and 20+ day layoffs as the norm —
 * while the meta for money was to hoard ten players and farm 商务 with a bench
 * that never plays. Injuries are now gated on fatigue (a rested player is
 * essentially safe), the just-healed are watched for two weeks, layoffs top
 * out at 18 days, a paid physio session restores condition and shortens
 * recovery, and no club may sign past seven players.
