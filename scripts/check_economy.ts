/**
 * The economy has two failure modes, and both were reported in one message:
 * a manager who pitched every fortnight compounded to forty deals and money
 * that stopped mattering, while one who never found the button starved on two
 * starting contracts. Five sponsor slots, pitches priced off the club rather
 * than off existing deals, sponsors who knock on their own, streaming that
 * fluctuates and spikes when the team wins, and prize money that moves a
 * balance sheet.
