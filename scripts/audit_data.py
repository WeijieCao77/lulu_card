"""Check the shipped world against itself and against what it was built from.

Not a smoke test — smoke.ts already proves the world loads and a season runs.
This asks the two questions that a build passing its own checks cannot answer:

  integrity  is the file internally consistent? every id resolves, every roster
             is playable, nobody is on two teams, no number is out of range
  accuracy   does it still say what the sources say? every person real, every
             club's roster the one vlr lists, every derived number traceable to
             a stat line rather than to a default that quietly filled in

Prints a line per check and exits non-zero if any fails, so it can gate a build.
Reads src/data/world.json and scripts/cache/*; writes nothing.
