Every person in the generated world is a real person. Nobody is invented: if a
fact is unknown it is left null and marked, never filled in with a plausible
substitute.

Attributes are derived from the real numbers by percentile — aim comes from a
player's actual ACS/ADR/HS%, awareness from their actual KAST and first-death
rate — so in-game ratings track how these players really perform.

# squad's wage bill stops matching what re-signing it would cost.
#
# The base used to be 15000, which put wages at 22% of a tier-1 club's sponsor
# income. Nothing was ever unaffordable: the average VCT club netted +$1.71M a
# season, only 3 of 48 could lose money at all, and one year's surplus bought
# four marquee players. At 33000 wages are ~49% of income — the largest single
# line, as they are for a real org — a quarter of the league runs close to the
# red, and a season's surplus buys about one signing.
#
# The tier-2 factor drops from 0.30 to 0.14 in the same move, which holds
# Challengers wages where they already were. Without that the Challengers
# insolvency this was meant to fix comes straight back (20 of 29 clubs under
# water), and it is the more truthful number anyway: a Challengers salary is a
