/**
 * The five-year settlement actually gets offered.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/check_midreview.ts
 *
 * It is one question asked once in a career, and there is no second chance to
 * ask it: if the condition misses, the player never learns anything was
 * supposed to happen. It shipped as `state.year === 2030`, which is exactly
 * right for a career started after it shipped and unreachable for one that was
 * already in 2031 — the players who had put the most hours in were the only
 * ones who could not get it. So this asserts the offer on three careers: one
 * that arrives at 2030 on schedule, one that was already past it, and one at
 * the finale, where the ten-year ending must win instead.
 *
 * The seasons are not played out day by day — the sack rules would end most
 * careers long before 2030, and this is a question about the calendar, not
 * about results. The clock is wound to the last day of a season instead and
 * advanced one turn, which is the state endSeason is entered from.
