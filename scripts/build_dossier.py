"""Fold the scraped profiles and team histories into one file the game imports.

Inputs (all already on disk, nothing is fetched here):
  scripts/cache/vlr_profiles.json       photo, flag, real name, winnings, placements
  scripts/cache/vlr_staff.json          the coaching staff, off each club's page
  scripts/cache/lp_faces.json           Liquipedia photos, for what vlr lacks
  scripts/cache/liquipedia_tenure.json  every club a player has been on, with dates
  src/data/world.json                   the players the game actually models

Outputs, deliberately two files:
  src/data/dossier.json   photo, flag, real name, winnings — every card needs
                          these, so they are imported into the main bundle
  src/data/records.json   club history and every event placement — 800KB that
                          only the dossier screen reads, so it is loaded on
                          demand instead of being paid for on first visit

Event names are deduplicated into their own table — 518 players share about
1600 tournaments between them, and spelling each one out per player tripled the
file for nothing.
