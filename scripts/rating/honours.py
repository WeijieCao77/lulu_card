"""
A ledger of honours: what a man actually won, when, at what level, and whether
he was on the server.

Sources, in this order: vlr's placements per player (src/data/records.json
`ev`, from the profile scrape — event id, place, team, stage), cross-checked
against the event stats pages we hold (was he in the rows, with rounds?), and
Liquipedia's title list (scripts/cache/lp_titles.json) for the champions and
masters wins it names. One event is one entry however many sites list it.

Value (the game's current table, kept so the comparison is like for like):
champions 3, masters 2, a regional split or Kickoff 1, Ascension 0.5 — for a
FIRST place only. Fades by seasons since: full for two, two thirds in the
third, a third in the fourth. Capped. Only honours dated before a cutoff count
at that cutoff. A player with no placement list at all is `unknown`, not
`none`.
