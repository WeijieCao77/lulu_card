 * Consecutive packs must not replay each other.

 *
 * 「还有十连卡的爆率是不是有点问题，开了两个十连卡包好像有九张卡都一样……」
 *
 * They were right, and the shape of it is why nobody could prove it: WITHIN a
 * ten-pack the draws were fine (0.09 duplicates in ten), so any single pack
 * looked normal. Across two packs, 7.2 of the 20 cards repeated.
 *
 * The account's rng seed was written back after ONE burn, before the caller
 * had drawn anything — so the next pack started one step behind where this one
 * started and walked almost the same sequence, offset by a single draw. Every
 * pack type was affected; the ten-pack is simply where ten cards at a time
 * made it visible.
 *
 * The bar here is arithmetic rather than a guess: drawing k cards from a pool
 * of n with replacement, the expected number of repeats is k − n(1 − (1−1/n)^k).
 * Two ten-packs draw about 20 cards from pools of 91 / 169 / 258, which is
 * under one repeat. Anything near seven is the bug coming back.
