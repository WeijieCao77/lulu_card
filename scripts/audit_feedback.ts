/**
 * Does the game tell you everything it did to you?
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit_feedback.ts [seasons]
 *
 * Two passes, because there are two ways feedback goes missing.
 *
 * 1. Actions. Every outward-facing action returns a sentence for the toast. An
 *    action that succeeds silently, or — worse — refuses silently, leaves the
 *    manager clicking a button that appears to do nothing. Each is called here
 *    for real, in both its working and its refused state, and the answer must
 *    be a sentence.
 *
 * 2. Turns. Advancing time changes money, squads, staff, contracts and moods
 *    on its own. The digest is the only place those surface, so a season is
 *    played out day by day with the state diffed across every advance: if
 *    something material moved and no note mentioned it, that is a change the
 *    manager had no way to see.
