/**
 * A fourteen-day wait that spans New Year is still a fourteen-day wait.
 *
 * The rollover sets day = 0 and used to leave every forward-looking timer at
 * its old absolute number. Two players sent screenshots of the wreckage: a
 * sponsor-pitch cooldown reading "296 天后可以再谈" (it is written as
 * day + 14), and a pending transfer bid waiting "334 天" for an answer that is
 * written as day + 7..10. This plays a career across the boundary and checks
 * every timer the state carries.
