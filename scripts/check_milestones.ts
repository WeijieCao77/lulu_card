/**
 * Week one, nobody plays a match — nobody "achieves" anything.
 *
 * Career milestones count the scraped history on purpose (a veteran's 500th
 * map matters). But the mark of what was already counted started undefined,
 * so the first tick read a total a player brought with him as something that
 * had just happened: four congratulations in a matchless week. First sight
 * now records where each career already stands, silently.
