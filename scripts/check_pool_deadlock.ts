/**
 * A transaction never asks the pool for a second connection.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/check_pool_deadlock.ts
 *
 * 2026-09-05, 「网页卡了」: the card page sat on 正在读取卡牌账号 for everyone,
 * Postgres idle, the process alive, every database request hanging until
 * the service was restarted. The ladder match ran in a transaction — one of
 * the pool's four connections — and then fetched its rival THROUGH THE POOL,
 * which needed a second. Four matches at once held all four and each waited
 * for a fifth; everything after them queued behind the deadlock forever.
 *
 * So the rule is asserted rather than remembered: while any transaction is
 * open, a call on the pool itself is an error. The proxy below throws on
 * exactly that, and a ladder draw at a division that wants a real rival —
 * the call that deadlocked — has to complete without tripping it.
