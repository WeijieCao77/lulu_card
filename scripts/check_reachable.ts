/**
 * Can every one of them actually happen?
 *
 * This exists because of the bug that got through: season.ts handed out
 * 'VALORANT Champions' while the verdicts asked for 'Champions', so eight
 * endings and two achievements were unreachable and nothing failed. The test
 * suite could not see it, because check_endings.ts built its careers by
 * awarding itself the same constant the conditions read — the test and the
 * code agreed, and both were wrong.
 *
 * So the rule here is: NOTHING is constructed from a constant this codebase
 * defines. Everything is built from what a PLAYED season was observed to
 * write — the honour strings the engine actually pushes, the counters it
 * actually moves, the values it actually reaches. If a condition cannot be
 * satisfied out of that harvested material, it cannot be satisfied by playing,
 * whatever the constants say.
 *
 * Three verdicts per entry:
 *   played  — it fired during an actual simulated career. Proof by play.
 *   built   — a state assembled ONLY from harvested material satisfies it.
 *   UNREACHABLE — neither. Something is wrong and it is named.
