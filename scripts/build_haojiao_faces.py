"""Fold 号角's rosters into the face sources, one club at a time.

号角 (web.haojiao.cc) is the one place that photographs the Chinese rosters —
the official VCT CN portraits, one consistent set, and it keeps them current
when a club refreshes its media day. vlr.gg and Liquipedia do not.

The site's API signs its requests, so nothing here fetches from it. The
rosters are read off the team pages in a browser — the page's own loaded
data, copied out as one line per player — into scripts/cache/haojiao_rosters.txt:

  club|ign|real name|icon path|is_sub|is_inactive|haojiao id

This script matches those lines against the players the game models and
writes the matches into scripts/cache/haojiao_faces.json, which
fetch_faces.py already reads. Identity is the same rule as every other face
source: the tag matches exactly (case-insensitively — the site capitalises
SLOWLY where vlr has slowly) AND the club agrees. A line whose club is not
the player's club in the game is reported, not used. The site's own
default_player.png is a placeholder, not a person, and is dropped.
