/**
 * The names the season awards, and the names the verdicts look for.
 *
 * These were two different lists. season.ts handed out 'VALORANT Champions';
 * endings.ts and achievements.ts both asked for 'Champions' and compared with
 * ===. Nothing threw, nothing failed a test, and every Champions-shaped ending
 * was simply unreachable — a three-time world champion finished his ten years
 * and was told 「有过高光」, and a genuine 全冠之年 was told he had never won on
 * the last day.
 *
 * check_endings.ts could not see it, because it builds its careers by awarding
 * INTL_TITLES to itself: the test and the code shared the wrong constant and
 * agreed. So this one refuses to name a title at all. It runs a season, reads
 * back what the world actually created, and asks the verdicts about THAT.
 * Rename either side and it fails.
