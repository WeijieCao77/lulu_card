 *
 * The save lives in localStorage, which is a hard per-origin budget — 5MB on
 * iOS Safari, counted in UTF-16, so 2.5 million characters for everything this
 * site stores: the autosave, any manual saves, the tutorial's parked copy, the
 * card mode and the profile. Three quarters of the audience is on a phone.
 *
 * When it runs out the browser refuses the write and the career stops being
 * saved, which is the worst failure this game has. It has happened twice —
 * 60,000 QuotaExceededErrors reported the first time, 134,000 the second — and
 * both times the cause was per-match paperwork nobody reads piling up through
 * a season, invisible until somebody looked at the dashboard.
 *
 * So it is a test now. A career is played out and the STORED string (packed,
 * exactly as saveGame writes it) is measured at its worst point, which is late
 * in a season with a full fixture list played. The budget below is the line
 * this must not cross; the breakdown prints either way, so a regression says
 * what grew as well as that something did.

// 1,500 until 2026-09-05. That day every AI club began to train the way the
// manager's squad does — experience on several attributes per man, map
// comfort in tenths at seventy-eight clubs — and a two-season save that had
// been sitting at 1,498 KB grew by the ~35 KB that state costs (measured:
// players 691 → 726 KB). The state is bounded (eight bars a player, thirteen
// maps a club) and the shrink below still handles a storage that refuses, so
// the budget moved by the amount explained rather than the growth being
// hidden by truncating what the AI knows.
// 1,600 until 2026-09-10. That day agent proficiency stopped being 100-or-0
// on three agents and became a graded table read off each man's career —
// thirteen entries a player instead of three, bounded by the agent roster
// (measured on a fresh save: agentPro 30 → 101 KB across 659 players, the
// peak 1,540 → 1,608 KB). Same reasoning as above: the state is bounded and
// explained, so the budget moves by what it costs.
