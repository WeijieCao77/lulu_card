"""Collect Challengers (tier-2) rosters from vlr.gg, slowly.

vlr.gg's robots.txt disallows only /search/auto and /rr/, and publishes no
crawl-delay — but "no published limit" is not "no limit": this project already
had its IP rate-limited once by running ~1000 requests in a short window.

So the pace is enforced here in code rather than by intention:

  * every request goes through _get(), which sleeps to keep >= MIN_INTERVAL
  * a 429 or 403 aborts the whole run and saves what was already collected
  * results are cached to disk and merged, never overwritten, so a re-run
    costs only the pages that are still missing

Usage:
    python3 scripts/fetch_vlr_challengers.py            # resume / top up
    python3 scripts/fetch_vlr_challengers.py --limit 5  # only 5 new teams
