/**
 * Nobody plays four against five.
 *
 * A player reported two things that turned out to be one story: a signing that
 * said "签约完成：X 加盟 Y" and never happened, and clubs fielding two and four
 * players in league matches. He had stripped his own squad, tried to rebuild
 * it through bids that all reported success and none of which landed, and the
 * game let him play the rest of the season short-handed — profitably, because
 * strength was a mean of who was present and a short side rated HIGHER.
