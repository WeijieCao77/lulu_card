/**
 * The five on the phone and the five on the desktop are the same five.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/check_cross_device.ts
 *
 * The report (2026-09-08): 「手机端和网页端的撸撸卡卡组配置不互通不同步」.
 * Two things were wrong, and this drives the real client module on two
 * fake devices against the real routes to show both, and then that they
 * are gone.
 *
 *   1. A device that had an unsent cosmetic edit — a five rearranged and the
 *      tab closed before the debounced save fired, which is every phone tab
 *      that gets swiped away — kept it in its mirror as "dirty". On its next
 *      open, days later, that dirty mirror was laid over the server's account
 *      and pushed up, regardless of what any other device had done since. So
 *      the desktop's new five was overwritten by the phone's old one the
 *      moment the phone was opened. Now the mirror's edit is only kept when
 *      the server is still at the revision the mirror was built on; if the
 *      account moved on somewhere else, the server's copy wins.
 *
 *   2. A tab left open never re-read the account. Set the five on the phone,
 *      go back to the desktop tab, and it still showed the old five until a
 *      reload — and editing it there then collided with the phone's. Now a
 *      tab coming to the front re-reads the account and takes the newer copy.
