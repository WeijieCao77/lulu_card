"""Collect career-long stats for every modelled player, into its own cache.

Why: attributes are currently derived from a single season (VCT 2026), so a
player having a bad year is modelled as a worse player. ZmjjKK won in 2024 and
has been good throughout; one poor split should move his *form*, not his
ceiling. The fix is to derive ability from a career window and let form carry
the slump — but that means re-deriving every attribute in the game, so the data
is gathered first and nothing is switched over until it is all here.

This writes ONLY to scripts/cache/vlr_career.json. It does not touch
src/data/world.json, and build_world.py does not read it yet.

vlr.gg publishes no crawl-delay; this project has been rate-limited once before
by volume, so >= 3s between requests, abort and save on 429/403, and the cache
merges rather than overwrites.
