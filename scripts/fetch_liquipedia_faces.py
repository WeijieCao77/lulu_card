"""The faces vlr.gg does not have, from Liquipedia.

After the vlr pass, 119 of the 518 players and 15 of the 69 coach cards still
had no photograph — mostly tier-two, Chinese and Pacific rosters. Liquipedia
has a picture for about a quarter of them.

Identity is the whole problem here, and it is solved by the filename. Liquipedia
names a player photo after the player — "M80 Boni at VCT 2026 Americas Stage
2.jpg" — while everything else on the page is a team logo or an event card. So
a file is only accepted when the person's own tag appears in it as a whole
word, which is a claim about who is in the picture that we can actually check.
Anything else is skipped. Putting the wrong face on a real professional is a
worse outcome than showing no face.

Liquipedia's terms: >= 2s between API calls, and only the API (direct page
fetches answer 403). Images are CC-BY-SA — the file page URL is kept per photo
so the credit can point at it.

Writes ONLY to scripts/cache/lp_faces.json.
