"""Download every face once, and keep a small copy in the repo.

Hotlinking somebody else's CDN on every card flip would spend their bandwidth
for us, so each picture is fetched once here, cut down to what a card actually
shows, and committed. Sources and credit are recorded in dossier.json's meta.

Four inputs, in order of preference:
  vlr_profiles.json   the player's own vlr.gg page      (399 players)
  vlr_staff.json      the club's staff listing on vlr    (coaches, 54)
  lp_faces.json       Liquipedia, for what neither has   (40 + 6)
  haojiao_faces.json  号角 haojiao.cc, for the Chinese and Pacific rosters that
                      none of the above photograph (21). Matched on exact tag
                      AND agreeing club, and the site's own default_player.png
                      is filtered out — it is a placeholder, not a person.
  legend_faces.json   Liquipedia event photos for the彩卡 (20) — a彩卡 is a
                      night, so it gets a picture from that night rather than
                      the studio portrait the ordinary card uses

Skips anything already on disk, so re-running after a partial scrape costs only
the new faces.
