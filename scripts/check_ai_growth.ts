/**
 * The world fights back — through its young, not through a league-wide dial.
 *
 * A player who trained a 90+ squad reported winning every title forever: AI
 * clubs felt like they never improved, and the first world championship began
 * a permanent procession. The answer has to come from the same engine the
 * manager uses, or it is cheating: AI clubs train by position with the very
 * judgement the training screen recommends, keep a player on a programme
 * until it pays out, rest the tired and the finished, and — once the manager
 * has taken a world title — push only their signed, high-upside youngsters a
 * bounded 10% per rivalry level. Winter re-evaluation is a youngster's
 * breakthrough, not a free top-up for whoever is near his ceiling.
 *
 * The two-season bands below are what that design measures, and they are
 * coupled: the players who make up the AI's top ten at kick-off are 76%
 * 23-and-under with about seven and a half points of headroom each, so the
 * youngsters realising 53% of their room IS the top ten gaining about +3.0
 * (0.76 × 7.4 × 0.53). The brief's estimate of +0.8 to +1.5 for the top ten
 * cannot coexist with its 30-50% for the youngsters; the youngsters are the
 * mechanism asked for, so that band is kept and the top-ten band follows
 * from it.
 *
 * Re-derived 2026-09-05, when AI clubs were given the manager's own team
 * sessions (跑图 / 复盘 / 练新英雄, every other week — see aiClubWeek in
 * engine/training.ts), the physio room and winter building work. The group
 * had reported that a club run by hand walked over a league that only ever
 * trained one attribute per man. A session every week measured the cohort
 * at +3.8 and the youngsters at 64%; every other week — the other week
 * being scrims and travel, which the AI does not model — measured +3.1 to
 * +3.3 and 52-54%, which is where the bands now sit. The runaway guard is
 * the long run, where potential and age cap the world: ten provoked seasons
 * peak around 93.5 (median of three seeds) and the league median falls back from its year-eight high.
